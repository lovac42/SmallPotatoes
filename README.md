# Small Potatoes: Show learning step count in days

## About:
This addon converts the learning steps from min to even days. So when loading deck config options, 1440 would be display as 1d, and 2880 displayed as 2d. It will be saved as regular numbers for mobile compatibility. Uneven numbers will not be converted.
